We made the graphs using Infogram and Datawrapper. For the data about the rise of feminist directors, we selected feminist directors from the feminist porn directory we found on Ms. Naughty’s website and checked how many films they made over the past 20 years through data from the internet adult film database. We then created an interactive graph where readers can click on a group of years to see the change- the rise of feminist porn through increased number of movies and directors is clearly visible.

Different feminist porn directors had different ideas of what they meant by feminist porn and the word ‘sex-positive.’ We investigated the rhetoric by going through the bios in the websites of each of the directors to see what terms mattered more or less to them. “Female perspective” was used by a lot of directors while “attractive men”  was used the least.  To represent this information the best visually, we went for a word chart, where frequently used words have a bigger, bolder font compared to less frequently used words, thus driving the point home for our readers and keeping up the aesthetic flow of our project.

It was hard to secure raw data from Pornhub so we compared what we thought were two interesting differences- the differences between what women SEARCH for more than men versus what they VIEW more than men. We divided that into top 5 categories each using an area graph that would be clear visually- with one glance readers can see which categories were viewed more.

We made the map using Cartodb. We got the data about the most searched terms in the United Sates by State from Pornhub’s website. We used the information about the polygon coordinates to be able to colour the whole state. The reader can hover over each state and see both the name of the state and the type of porn.

To ensure that our data was sound, we interviewed porn directors and porn stars to confirm that what the data was saying about the porn industry changing was actually true. In addition to this, we supplemented our data with anecdotal evidence from actual young women who like to watch porn, whether it was feminist or mainstream. We found it difficult to find women willing to speak out about the topic, as it is still a bit sensitive a topic, but eventually we were able to find a handful of good interviewees, even if some of them wanted to be anonymous.
